         <p><em>Oh hey!</em> Welcome to the Cereal Corner. While you're here, you can learn about anything cereal
            related.</p><br><br><br>
         <p>Whether it be breakfast, dessert, midafternoon snack or midnight snack, cereal is always a great option
            for hungry stomachs. In fact, it's no exaggeration to say that cereal is possibly one of the most underrated
            foods in the grocery store.
            But I get it, choosing from endless options in the cereal aisle can seem almost impossible at first.
            Hopefully this website can help change that for you. Look at the cards below to learn about some factors to
            take into account before picking out cereal. Then, check out the <a href="/custom.html">Your Cereals</a>
            page to help you select what cereals you should buy based on your preferences!

               <h3>Mixing Value: </h3>
               <p>Mixing value represents how well a cereal can mix with granola or other cereals.
                  Mixing cereals is a great way to add flavor and diversify the texture of each bite. Mixing is such a
                  underrated aspect of cereal, since it opens up so many new possibilities and flavors.

               <h3>Chocolatiness: </h3>
               <p>Chocolate Cereals are a favorite for many. You can thank them for the classic
                  chocolate milk that's left in your bowl when you're done with your cereal. Rate a 5 for no
                  consideration
                  towards chocolatiness, or higher/lower depending on your preference.

               <h3>Healthiness: </h3>
               <p>News flash! Cereal does not have to be an unhealthy breakfast option. Healthy
                  cereals shouldn't be highly processed and can usually be identified by their low sugar and high whole
                  grain contents. Luckily, you don't need to sacrifice great taste :)

               <h3>Fruit Value: </h3>
               <p>A cereal's fruit value corresponds to how well it pairs with fruit. Adding fruit
                  to cereal is a great way to make your meal both healthier and tastier! Some great fruits to add are
                  strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, or raspberries.

               <h3>Sugary Sweetness: </h3>
               <p>Sugary cereals are great for people who have a strong sweet tooth. They make
                  amazing snacks or desserts, and are also great ways to treat yourself for breakfast.

         <h3>Diversity: </h3>
         <p> The final thing to think about is your cereal order's diversity. How many different types
            of cereal do you hope to buy? Do you want the same thing every morning or do you like to have a large
            rotation?
            When choosing your cereal order, note that a diversity rating of 10 corresponds to a limit of buying only up
            to
            one box of each cereal, while a rating of 1 corresponds to a limit of 6.
         </p>
         <br>
         <p>Also, note that the "Conserve my Money" checkbox will optimize your order with price in mind, giving you the
            most ounces of cereal for your specified price point and cereal preference. </p>
