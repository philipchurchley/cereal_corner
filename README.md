This website was created using html, css, and javascript. The "Create your own Cereal Order" generator operates using ratings of 21 cereals based on the personal experience of 20 years eating cereal almost every day. Although each rating was intended to avoid any bias, it should be noted that there will always be a level of subjectivity. Each recommendation is generated using a greedy algorithm that selects cereals with the best value given the user's input. When the "conserve my money" option is selected, the recommendations are generated using dynamic programming. The algorithm used is similar to that of the 0-1 knapsack problem, with "weights" determined by each cereal's approximate price per ounce.
